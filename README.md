        # Project: Analysis of Netflix Shows Dataset

## Dataset Description
      This project analyzes the Netflix Shows dataset, which includes information about various shows available on Netflix.

## Difficulties Encountered
      1. **File Size**: The dataset was quite large, which made the import process slower than expected.
      2. **Data Types**: Some columns had inconsistent data types, requiring manual adjustment during the import process.
      3. **Encoding Issues**: There were encoding issues with some special characters, which required using the correct encoding format during import.

## Interesting Finding
    One interesting finding from the dataset is that the majority of shows on Netflix are categorized under 'Drama' and 'Comedy'. This indicates a strong preference for these genres among Netflix content offerings.
